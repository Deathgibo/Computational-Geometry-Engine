Computational Geometry Engine has some algorithms like convex hulls, triangulation, line intersection, and attempted voronoi.

-Controls-
press 1 - goes to fortunes algorithm which isn't fully functional but works with small amount of point
press 2 - goes to line intersection algorithm which is based off a sweep line method
press 3 - goes to convex hull, triangulation, and incremental voronoi which only works if you place 3 points at the beggining and every other point inside the triangle formed by it

right click creates points, you can drag them, and mouse wheel changes size of points.
