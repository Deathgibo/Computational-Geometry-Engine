e(p,q)- euclidean distance between p and q points
dp(q) - gives the distance from any other point to q
d(p) - outputs the closest points in the set of sites to p 
Bpq - set of points of equal distance, bisector, between 2 sites p and q
Rp - is a convex polygon, perhaps unbounded, containing p
*(z) - maps (zx, zy) -> (zx, zy + d(z))

theres this notion of C- and C+

Cs is positive if

get first one in a,b,c
if a.x < intersection.x its good

-notes-
.make sure when we call Q->remove, we also set the pointer back to NULL
. breaks at deletetripple right after is on RIGHTDELETe, LEFTDELETE, also addvertextoedge error edge has 2 points already
. maybe have to make Q a direct pointer
. check the internal node point to two of same things see if that happens and resolve
